Hi! I am currently a fourth-year B.S. Computer Science student at [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/), [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/). I work as an undergraduate researcher at Visual Intelligence Lab supervised by [Prof. Huaizu Jiang](https://jianghz.me/).

My research interest lies in the fields of computer vision and deep learning. I'm driven by a deep curiosity surrounding the integration of human-interpretable information and knowledge within architectural frameworks, with the aim of shaping behavior and enhancing generalization capabilities across diverse applications. I am particularly motivated to unravel the nuances of architectural designs that demonstrate exceptional proficiency in learning fundamental feature representations, and investigate how we can strategically reducing model complexity without compromising robustness, while maintaining the capacity for effective problem-solving.

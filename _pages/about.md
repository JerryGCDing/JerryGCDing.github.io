Hi! I am currently a Research Assistant at Visual Intelligence Lab at Northeastern supervised by [Prof. Huaizu Jiang](https://jianghz.me/). I graduated with B.S. Computer Science degree from [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/), [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/).

My research interest lies in the fields of computer vision and deep learning. I'm driven by a deep curiosity surrounding the integration of human-interpretable information and knowledge within architectural frameworks, with the aim of shaping behavior and enhancing generalization capabilities across diverse applications. I am particularly motivated to unravel the nuances of architectural designs that demonstrate exceptional proficiency in learning fundamental feature representations, and investigate how we can strategically reducing model complexity without compromising robustness, while maintaining the capacity for effective problem-solving.

One of my personal passions is crafting blog posts that highlight the key insights and my thought processes behind the innovative solutions that drive breakthroughs in my research projects. 
I firmly believe that sharing these experiences can not only inspire others but also shed light on the fundamental issues at the core of the topics I've explored.
